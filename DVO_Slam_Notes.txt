*** DVO Slam Notes ***
Dependencies:
	Eigen


A full example application, though running through ROS, can be found at: 

dvo_slam/dvo_benchmark/src/benchmark_slam.cpp

The object KeyframeTracker seems to do the tracking and graph mapping working

Q: Is it worth figuring out how to get ROS working to test these codes out? Many of the newer Visual Slam applications use ROS. If so, this will take work.

***
dvo_slam/dvo_benchmark/src/benchmark_slam.cpp:

Eigen::Affine3d is a Transformation of the form:
[R t
0  1]

std::ostream is used for writing out trajectories	

***
dvo_slam/dvo_core/src/core/rgbd_image.cpp
	Defines most of the operations upon images
		-Derivatives
		-Warping

***
dvo_core/src/dense_tracking.cpp
	DenseTracker::math() does the frame to frame matching.
		-It calls a lot of the math subroutines

*** STRUCTURE ***
There are clear layers from:
	Keyframe tracker
	Within Keyframe map
	Between frame tracking

Keyframe_tracker: main object, calls
	local_tracker, which calls
		local_map, which implements
			g2o routines

*** This is the main layer of calls ***
Keyframe_tracker::update, which calls:
	LocalTracker::update, which calls:
		LocalTrackerImpl::match, which calls:
			DenseTrack::match
				-This matches frame	

TODO: Figure out how graph optimization callbacks are signaled.
